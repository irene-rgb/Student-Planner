# Student-Planner

Scenario: 
I’ve noticed the people around me constantly are applying to dozens of internships and programs. Tracking internships is a tedious task that requires multiple webpages and lots of energy. In conversation, my sister brought up ideas for an all-in-one program organizer. 

Consultation: 
During consultation, she asked me to make an internship organizer with both calendar and spreadsheet view. She should be able to save responses and tag keywords to easily reuse responses for similar questions on other applications. In spreadsheet view, she wanted to be able to sort by start date, deadline, category, or status. In calendar view, the user should be able to see when all programs start and when their deadlines are. After consultation, documented in Appendix 2 and 3, I decided to make this project for my computer science internal assessment. I chose to make my sister my client and my computer science teacher my adviser. 

Rationale: 
The rationale for my project is simple. I want to make an organizer that solves the problems students like my sister and myself have with using multiple inadequate programs to track our internship applications. 
The solution I decided on was to use Java in Eclipse because Java is the language I have most experience with and Eclipse because it has a GUI interface I am familiar with, saving me time from having to learn a new language and new interface. 
The best part of using Eclipse is that it is extensively used for application development and allows easy building of frames and buttons which can be visualized while coding. These aspects will allow me to make an easy-to-use application and visualize the UX while coding.
